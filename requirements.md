I want to scaffold out a project, especially for CSS and JavaScript. (done)

I want there to be an option to create either .scss or .less files and this option should be resusable. (done)

I want to download bower.json, package.json and the core style" file from GitHub. (done, but the 'download-status' module isn't working properly)

I want a task that runs "npm install" and "bower install" after the files have downloaded.

I want there to be an option to add a "build" folder. (done)

I want a styleguide as part of the build.
