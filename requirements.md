I want to scaffold out a project, especially for CSS and JavaScript.

I want there to be an option to create either .scss or .less files and this option should be resusable.

I want to download bower.json, package.json and the core style" file from GitHub.

I want a task that runs "npm install" and "bower install" after the files have downloaded.

I want there to be an option to add a "build" folder.

I want a styleguide as part of the build.
