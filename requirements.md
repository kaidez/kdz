I want to scaffold out a project, especially for CSS and JavaScript. (done)

I want there to be an option to create either .scss or .less files and this option should be resusable. (done)

I want to download my core bower.json, package.json and .gitignore files as well as the core Bootstrap.css  file from GitHub. (Done)

I want a task that runs "npm install" and "bower install" after the files have downloaded. (Nope...doesn't make sense)

I want there to be an option to add a "build" folder. (done)

I want a styleguide as part of the build (in progress).
